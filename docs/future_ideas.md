📜 SuperQuester: Future Roadmap & Ideas
1. 🎥 The Camera API (Cinematics)
Current Status: Not Implemented

Quest Previews: Add a "Scout Location" button to the Quest Contract. When clicked, the camera detaches and flies to the target location (e.g., the Graveyard) for 5 seconds to show the player where to go.

Intro Sequences: When a player first joins the world, play a flyover cutscene of the town while the "Welcome" title displays.

Victory Cam: On completing a "Legendary" quest, pan the camera around the player in third-person while playing a victory sound.

2. 📦 Volumes (Invisible Triggers)
Current Status: Safe Zone is rudimentary (radius check)

Atmosphere Shifts: Create a volume around the town. When entered:

Fade music to "Town Theme".

Change sky fog to a warm, inviting color.

Display title: "§6Fuquay Village§r".

Dungeon Entrances: Detect when a player enters a specific cave mouth and automatically trigger a "Quest Accepted" or "Warning" message.

Trap Rooms: A room that locks the doors behind the player (fills air blocks with fences) until all mobs are dead.

3. ✨ Visual "Juice" (Particles)
Current Status: Basic "Villager Happy" particles on turn-in

Quest Board Markers: Spawn a permanent "Gold Sparkle" emitter above the Quest Board so players can easily spot it at night.

Loot Beams: When a reward is given, spawn a vertical beam of light (End Rod particles) and a shockwave at the player's feet.

Status Indicators:

Cursed: Purple drip particles follow the player.

Buffed: Gold swirl particles around the player's legs.

4. 🪄 Custom Item Components (Magic Items)
Current Status: Standard vanilla items

Town Portal Scroll: A paper item named "Return Scroll." When used (held for 3 seconds), it teleports the player safely back to the Quest Board.

Quest Compass: An item that, when held, points to the coordinates of the currently active quest target.

Summoning Totem: An item that spawns a mini-boss (for a specific quest) when placed on a specific block.

5. 🎰 The Gacha System (Economy & Rewards)
Current Status: Concept Phase

Quest Points (QP):
- A virtual currency earned by completing quests (stored in a Scoreboard).
- Displayed on the sidebar or below the user's name.

Board Refresh (The "Mulligan"):
- Instead of waiting 24 hours (or using admin commands), players can spend QP to "Refresh" the daily quest board immediately.
- "Don't like these quests? Pay 50 QP to reroll!"

Gacha Reward Capsules:
- Players spend QP to buy "Mystery Capsules" (Spawn Eggs or Crates).
- Tiers:
  - Common (100 QP): Food, basic resources, iron.
  - Rare (300 QP): Enchanted books, diamond gear, music discs.
  - Legendary (1000 QP): Custom pets, particle trails, mending books.

📜 SuperQuester: Future Roadmap & Ideas
1. 🎥 The Camera API (Cinematics)
Current Status: Not Implemented

Quest Previews: Add a "Scout Location" button to the Quest Contract. When clicked, the camera detaches and flies to the target location (e.g., the Graveyard) for 5 seconds to show the player where to go.

Intro Sequences: When a player first joins the world, play a flyover cutscene of the town while the "Welcome" title displays.

Victory Cam: On completing a "Legendary" quest, pan the camera around the player in third-person while playing a victory sound.

2. 📦 Volumes (Invisible Triggers)
Current Status: Safe Zone is rudimentary (radius check)

Atmosphere Shifts: Create a volume around the town. When entered:

Fade music to "Town Theme".

Change sky fog to a warm, inviting color.

Display title: "§6Fuquay Village§r".

Dungeon Entrances: Detect when a player enters a specific cave mouth and automatically trigger a "Quest Accepted" or "Warning" message.

Trap Rooms: A room that locks the doors behind the player (fills air blocks with fences) until all mobs are dead.

3. ✨ Visual "Juice" (Particles)
Current Status: Basic "Villager Happy" particles on turn-in

Quest Board Markers: Spawn a permanent "Gold Sparkle" emitter above the Quest Board so players can easily spot it at night.

Loot Beams: When a reward is given, spawn a vertical beam of light (End Rod particles) and a shockwave at the player's feet.

Status Indicators:

Cursed: Purple drip particles follow the player.

Buffed: Gold swirl particles around the player's legs.

4. 🪄 Custom Item Components (Magic Items)
Current Status: Standard vanilla items

Town Portal Scroll: A paper item named "Return Scroll." When used (held for 3 seconds), it teleports the player safely back to the Quest Board.

Quest Compass: An item that, when held, points to the coordinates of the currently active quest target.

Summoning Totem: An item that spawns a mini-boss (for a specific quest) when placed on a specific block.

5. 🎰 The Gacha System (Economy & Rewards)
Current Status: Concept Phase

Super Points (SP):
- A virtual currency earned by completing quests (stored in a Scoreboard).
- Displayed on the sidebar or below the user's name.

Gacha Reward Capsules:
- Players spend SP to buy "Mystery Capsules" (Spawn Eggs or Crates).
- Tiers:
  - Common (100 SP): Food, basic resources, iron.
  - Rare (300 SP): Enchanted books, diamond gear, music discs.
  - Legendary (1000 SP): Custom pets, particle trails, mending books.


6. Loot Explosion & Reward Celebration System
When you complete a quest or hit SP milestones, the game celebrates you — gold coins burst from your position with custom particle effects, a triumphant sound effect plays, floating "+50 SP" text rises and fades, maybe even a brief screen flash. Think Diablo loot explosions meets mobile game dopamine hits. Every quest completion becomes a moment.
Why it works: Immediate, visceral feedback loop. Your kids will want to complete quests just to see the celebration again.

7. Custom Boss Encounters with Phase Mechanics
Your mythic/legendary encounters spawn a visually distinct boss mob (custom geometry, glowing effects, particle auras) with a dramatic custom health bar UI at the top of the screen. The boss has phases — at 50% health, music intensifies, it summons adds, the arena changes. Victory triggers a massive celebration sequence.
Why it works: Nothing says "this isn't vanilla" like fighting a glowing three-phase boss with its own health bar and soundtrack.

8. Cosmetic Rewards & Player Flair System
Spend SP on visible cosmetics: particle trails when you walk, floating titles above your head ("Dragon Slayer," "Quest Master"), custom death effects, maybe even summonable cosmetic pets. Your progression becomes visible to others on the server.
Why it works: Gives SP lasting meaning beyond transactions. Your seven-year-old can show off their sparkle trail to siblings.

9. Companion System
Summon quest companions — a spectral wolf, a tiny golem helper, a floating wisp. They follow you, maybe assist in combat or provide small buffs. Unlockable/purchasable with SP, with rarer companions having cooler visual effects.
Why it works: Kids love pets. Having your own glowing spirit wolf companion is inherently cool.
